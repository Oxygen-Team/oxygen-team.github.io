    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">Innovative is committed to protecting your privacy. Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don't collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, i.e., no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration. We designed our systems not to have sensitive data about you; even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin:0cm 0cm 7.5pt;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;white-space:normal;">
    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">This Privacy Policy describes how INNOVATIVE CONNECTING PTE. LIMITED and its affiliates ("Innovative," "we," "our" or "us") collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of our websites (including freevpnapp.net), services, and applications (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") does not apply to information you may process when using our Services.</span>

    <span style="font-size:10px;color:#000000;">Our VPN APP is a non-obligatory log network. Innovative are not available for the information related to the personal information of users, including but not limited to names (subscriber names, user names and screen names), addresses (including mailing addresses, residential address, business addresses) and telephones, unless the data you provide depending on the context of your interactions with us and the choices you make, including your privacy settings, and the products and features you use for the purpose of administering your subscription and for the purpose to enjoy our VPN services. Except for the limited exceptions, we don't automatically collect any Personal Information from you.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin:0cm 0cm 7.5pt;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;white-space:normal;">
    <span style="font-size:10px;color:#000000;">When you open the APP seeking for our VPN services, the APP assigns a unique identifier to you for the service (such unique identifier just binds up with your device identification code, but does not tie to any other personal information of users). When you use the VPN services, we will check your account information through this unique identifier to determine the level of service you have signed up for before establishing your VPN connection.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin:0cm 0cm 7.5pt;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;white-space:normal;">
    <span style="font-size:10px;color:#000000;">With some forms of payment, certain Mac version of our VPN services may redirect you to the website of a third-party payment processor (namely PayPal) to complete the transaction. To understand what personal information the processor collects and stores, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy. Therefore, except for the limited exception above, we do not know any means or source of user's detailed payment for VPN services (including any credit card or bank account number) or any billing records either.</span>

    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">We collect information about whether a VPN connection is successful on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which country/ISP (but not your source IP address).

    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user. It is one of our service principles to provide unlimited data transfer, however if we notice that a user occupies more traffic than thousands of others combined, what influence other users to enjoy high-quality service, we may seek for the reason with the user.</span>

    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">When you become one of our users for the VPN services, with your permission, we collect minimal usage statistics and anonymized analytics data used for network diagnostics in our network operations tools, for the purpose to optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems related to specific apps, VPN servers, or ISPs. Learning and analyzing the statistics allows us to improve the quality of the services and the products. We ensure the information we receive is fully anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store IP addresses).</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin:0cm 0cm 7.5pt;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;white-space:normal;">

    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">We collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service. Although we provide service to users improving the network speed, we can't uniquely identify any specific behavior of any user, because thousands of users share one same location simultaneously to enjoy surfing the internet and the usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.</span>

        <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="color:#000000;">Required by any foreign law enforcement agencies, Innovative turns over protected user information only upon receipt of a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, which shall be served effectively under the Rules of Court of Singapore. More specifically, we think the subpoena, court order or search warrant may lose its coercive effect when it crosses its boundary. It only regains coercive effect on the other side of the line either through a domestication action (in the other state's courts) or under the authority of a statute. Additionally, we will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order. Should we receive a valid served legal order, it is important to note that Innovative does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.</span><br>

    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">Innovative is committed to protecting your information. We use best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information. Access to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.</span>

    <span style="color:#000000;font-size:10px;">Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.</span>
